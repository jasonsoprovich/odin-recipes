    <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Italian beef sandwiches are a classic comfort food, combining thinly sliced, tender roast beef with rich, savory
        flavors. The beef is typically slow-cooked in a seasoned broth made with garlic, herbs, and often peppers for a zesty
        kick. Once the meat is infused with flavor and fall-apart tender, it is served on a crusty roll, often topped with
        giardiniera or sautéed peppers.</p>
    
        <p>These sandwiches are beloved for their versatility—you can enjoy them "dry" (lightly dipped in jus) or fully "dipped,"
        where the bread absorbs the flavorful cooking juices. Italian beef sandwiches are a staple of Chicago cuisine, perfect
        for hearty meals or gatherings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>    
        <ul>
            <li>3 to 4 pound chuck roast or round roast <em>trimmed of large chunks
                of excess fat</em></li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>14.5 ounce can beef broth <em>divided</em></li>
            <li>8 ounces pepperoncini pepper slices <em>plus 1/4 cup of juice and 
                additional peppers for serving</em></li>
            <li>8 ounces giardiniera (mild or spicy) <em>drained, plus additional 
                for serving (look for the kind that is chopped, versus whole 
                pickled vegetables)</em></li>
            <li>Provolone cheese slices <em>for serving</em></li>
            <li>Hoagie buns <em>for serving</em></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon thyme dried <em>ground</em></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let the meat rest at room temperature for 15 minutes (this is a 
                good time to measure your other spices and seasonings). Season 
                the beef all over with kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high. Once it is 
                hot, sear the meat on all sides until golden brown, moving it 
                as little as possible so that it develops a nice crust (this 
                will take about 10 minutes). Transfer to the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to medium. Carefully splash in some of the broth 
                and with a wooden spoon, scrape up the brown bits on the bottom 
                of the pan (this is FLAVOR). Pour the liquid and any bits into 
                the slow cooker on top of the beef.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the seasoning ingredients: 
                Italian seasoning, granulated sugar, garlic powder, onion
                powder, salt, black pepper, and thyme. Sprinkle on top of the 
                beef.</li>
            <li>Add the pepperoncini peppers and juice. Add the giardiniera (do 
                not add any giardiniera juice).</li>
            <li>Pour in the remaining broth.</li>
            <li>Cover the crockpot and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours, or until 
                meat shreds easily with a fork. Shred the beef, then stir it 
                together with the juices. Cover and cook on low for 30 
                additional minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, split the hoagie buns and toast on a baking sheet 
                in the oven at 350 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes (if desired).
                Fill with the shredded Italian beef (get plenty of that yummy, 
                messy juice!) and top with provolone, pepperoncini, and
                Giardiniera as desired. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
