                <h1>Sous Vide Smoked Brisket</h1>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>Sous vide smoked brisket is a modern twist on traditional barbecue, 
                    combining precise sous vide cooking with the rich, smoky flavors 
                    of outdoor grilling or oven roasting. The brisket is first seasoned 
                    and vacuum-sealed, then cooked in a water bath at a low, steady 
                    temperature for an extended period, usually around 36 hours. 
                    This ensures the meat becomes incredibly tender while retaining 
                    its moisture.</p>
                    <p>After sous vide cooking, the brisket is finished by smoking it on 
                    a grill or roasting it in the oven to develop a flavorful, crispy bark. 
                    The result is a perfectly tender brisket with a smoky exterior and a 
                    juicy interior. This method is ideal for achieving consistent results 
                    and deep flavor with less guesswork compared to traditional barbecue
                    techniques.</p>

                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine pepper, salt, and pink salt (if using) in a small bowl. Rub two-thirds of mixture evenly over surface of
                    brisket. Reserve remaining one-third of mixture. Slice brisket in half crosswise in order to fit into large vacuum bags.</li> 
                    <li>Place each brisket half in a vacuum bag. (Fold over the top of each bag while you add brisket so that no rub or juices
                    get on the edges of bags, which can weaken the seal.) Add 4 drops (about 1/8 teaspoon) liquid smoke, if using, to each
                    bag. Seal bags using a vacuum sealer and let rest for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Set your precision cooker to 135°F (57°C) for brisket with a tender, steak-like texture, or 155°F (68°C) for more
                    traditionally textured brisket that falls apart when you pull at it. Add brisket to water bath and cover it with a lid,
                    aluminum foil, or ping pong balls. Cook for 24 to 36 hours at 155°F or 36 to 72 hours at 135°F. Allow cooked brisket to
                    cool at least to room temperature before proceeding (an ice bath can speed up this process). Brisket can be stored in
                    the refrigerator at this stage for up to 1 week before finishing.</li>
                    <li>To Finish on the Grill: Light 1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out
                    and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5
                    minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.
                    Clean and oil grilling grate.</li>
                    <li>Remove brisket from bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite
                    barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket.
                    Place brisket on cooler side of grill, fat cap up. Add 4 to 5 hardwood chunks to hotter side of grill. (If using a gas
                    grill, wrap wood chunks loosely in aluminum foil before placing over hotter side of grill.) Cover and allow brisket to
                    smoke, adjusting vents to maintain a temperature between 275 and 300°F (135 and 149°C) and adding 2 to 3 wood chunks
                    twice during cooking. Smoke until a deep, dark bark has formed, about 3 hours. Continue with step 7.</li>
                    <li>To Finish in the Oven: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). (If your oven has a
                    convection setting, turn it on and adjust heat to 275°F/135°C instead.) Remove brisket from sous vide bags and carefully
                    blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide
                    extra flavor.) Rub reserved salt-and-pepper mixture into surface of brisket. Place brisket on a wire rack set in a
                    rimmed baking sheet, fat cap up, and place in oven. Roast until a deep, dark bark has formed, about 2 hours. Continue
                    with step 7.</li>
                    <li>Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest until the temperature drops to between 145 and
                    165°F (63 and 74°C), about 30 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve with white bread, dill
                    pickles, and sliced onion.</li>
